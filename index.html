              <p>
                My name is Jishnu Raychaudhuri and I'm a senior at the University of Colorado, Boulder. 
                I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Applied Mathematics with an emphasis on Statistics. 
                Within the realm of CS, I'd say I'm interested in a variety of things such as Cybersecurity, Database architecture and management, and Network systems. 
                But I'd say I'm most interested in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, as is evident by my Stats emphasis in my APPM minor. 
                I hope to forge a career in this field. 
                Currently, I'm looking for an entry-level software job as I'd like to gain a few years of industry experience before heading to graduate school for a Master's degree.  
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the summer, I worked as an undergraduate researcher via the CU SPUR programme and had the opportunity to work with Quantum Magnetometers that pick up tiny electrical impulses in our brains (Magnetoencephalography) for Brain Machine Interfaces. 
                I loved the experience. I enjoyed the self-driven nature of research and found the experience quite rewarding. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Outside of CS, I very much enjoy watching art films, listening to experimental music, and other various forms of art. 
                I was ecstatic when I found out about CU's rich history in experimental cinema and moving image arts. 
                I also find it amazing that CU has its very own arthouse theatre, one of the 14 arthouse theatres in the entire US, where they host something called the International Film Series to showcase groundbreaking films from all across the world. 
                I have had the opportunity to watch a lot of amazing films from a lot of brilliant filmmakers via the IFS. 
                I am also currently attending, but not enrolled in, a grad-level course called CMDP 7300 - Theories of Avant Garde where we get together and discuss a lot of art that challenges our notions of what art really is, from performance art to literature.
